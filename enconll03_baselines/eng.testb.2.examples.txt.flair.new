I O

I O
think O
that O

which O

said O
it O
would O

but O
that O
Zywiec I-ORG

potential O
production O
of O

was O
a O
medium-term O

rather O
than O
a O
short-term O
one O
. O

He O
said O
his O

would O
be O

off O

The O

refer O

Trade O

Industry O
Secretary O
Ian I-PER
Lang I-PER
added O
that O
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were O
met O
by O
both O
airlines O
, O
final O
clearance O
would O
hinge O
on O
an O
open O

deal O
between O
Britain I-LOC

the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
liberalise O
trans-Atlantic O

which O
would O

, O
which O
was O
asked O

" O
I O
agree O
... O
that O
without O

lead O

a O
significant O

there O

no O

the O

whether O

be O
cleared O
. O

The O
conditions O
for O

that O

" O

However O
, O
it O

the O

" O
more O
severe O

those O
imposed O
by O
other O
regulatory O
authorities O
on O
similar O

. O

British I-ORG
Airways I-ORG
's O
initial O
response O
was O
that O
" O
unconditional O
divestiture O
of O

is O
unprecedented O
and O
if O
done O
it O
must O
be O
on O
the O

It O

" O

The O

said O
both O

Lieutenant-General O

told O
a O

in O
Nairobi I-LOC
his O
main O
concern O
was O
for O
a O
large O
group O
of O
about O
150,000 O

living O
off O

If O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
necessary O

safe O
for O

, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
airdrops O
of O
food O
for O
the O
refugees O
, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa I-LOC
and O
the O
Zairean I-MISC
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O

he O
said O

" O
Tomorrow O
I O

General O
Baril I-PER
saw O
rebel O

Laurent I-PER
Kabila I-PER
in O
Goma I-LOC
last O
week O
but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan I-MISC
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O

force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O

Kinshasa I-LOC

Canadian I-MISC

said O
on O
Thursday O
that O
the O

probably O
not O

or O
intervene O
militarily O
in O
any O
major O
way O

" O
It O

as O
though O
they O
( O

) O
are O
going O

" O
Young I-PER
told O
reporters O
. O

But O
General O
Baril I-PER
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O
. O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O

" O
If O
they O
ca O

move O

they O
are O
too O
weak O

then O
we O
will O
probably O
consider O
very O
seriously O
using O

complex O

it O

dangerous O

Van I-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
the O
tough O
competition O
had O
prevented O
Zywiec I-ORG
from O
raising O
prices O
in O
line O
with O
inflation O
, O
which O
had O
added O
to O
the O
pressure O
on O

He O
said O
advertising O

also O
increase O

he O
said O
the O

investment O
of O
more O
than O
$ O
100 O
million O
already O
this O

, O
largely O

, O
would O
help O
position O
it O

compete O
with O
such O
competitors O
as O
brewers O
from O
the O
neighbouring O
Czech I-LOC
Republic I-LOC
. O

Some O
analysts O
say O
cheaper O

high-quality O
Czech I-MISC
imports O
could O
invade O
Poland I-LOC
once O
tariffs O
for O
CEFTA I-ORG

are O
lifted O
in O
1998 O
, O
but O
van I-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
says O
such O
a O
threat O
might O
be O
exaggerated O
despite O
the O
Czech I-MISC
beer O
market O
's O
overcapacity O
. O

" O
I O
think O
Polish I-MISC
consumers O
in O

are O
quite O
proud O
of O
their O

I O
'm O
speaking O
about O
all O

and O
as O
we O
make O
good O

... O

I O
think O
that O
this O
fidelity O
to O
our O

is O
a O
factor O
which O
can O
limit O
the O
Czech I-MISC

, O
" O

Van I-PER
Boxmeer I-PER
said O
Zywiec I-ORG
had O
its O
eye O
on O
Okocim I-ORG
, O
which O
has O
said O
it O
would O
start O
producing O
Carlsberg I-ORG
beer O
next O
year O
, O
but O
that O
Zywiec I-ORG
's O
potential O
production O
of O
Heineken I-ORG
was O
a O
medium-term O
possibility O
rather O
than O
a O
short-term O
one O
. O

He O
said O
his O
firm O
would O
be O
better O
off O
concentrating O
on O
its O
leading O
brand O
, O
Zywiec I-ORG
Full I-ORG

Secretary O

Lang I-PER
added O
that O
even O
if O
the O
conditions O
were O
met O
by O
both O
airlines O
, O
final O
clearance O
would O
hinge O
on O
an O
open O

between O
Britain I-LOC

the O
United I-LOC
States I-LOC
to O
liberalise O
trans-Atlantic O

which O
would O

which O
was O

" O
I O
agree O

that O
without O

there O

no O

The O
conditions O

British I-ORG

initial O
response O
was O
that O
" O
unconditional O

Lieutenant-General O

told O

his O
main O
concern O
was O
for O
a O
large O
group O
of O
about O
150,000 O

living O
off O

If O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
necessary O

safe O
for O

, O
he O
would O
not O
hesitate O
to O
order O
airdrops O
of O
food O
for O
the O
refugees O
, O
even O
against O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
government O
in O
Kinshasa I-LOC
and O
the O
Zairean I-MISC
rebels O
who O
control O
much O
of O

he O
said O

" O
Tomorrow O
I O

going O

to O
go O

General O
Baril I-PER
saw O
rebel O
leader O
Laurent I-PER
Kabila I-PER
in O
Goma I-LOC
last O
week O
but O
the O
rebels O
told O
him O
the O
crisis O
was O
over O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Rwandan I-MISC
refugees O
have O
already O
gone O
home O
. O

The O
rebels O
do O
not O
want O
the O

force O
to O
deploy O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
for O
fear O
it O

help O
the O

control O
of O
the O

Kinshasa I-LOC
opposes O

Canadian I-MISC

Minister O

on O
Thursday O
that O
the O

probably O
not O

or O
intervene O
militarily O
in O
any O
major O
way O

" O
It O
does O

look O
as O
though O
they O
( O
airdrops O
) O
are O
going O
to O
be O
required O
in O
any O

" O
Young I-PER
told O
reporters O
. O

But O
General O
Baril I-PER
said O
it O
would O
be O
premature O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
course O
of O
action O
until O
he O
had O
more O
information O

" O
We O
hope O
that O
if O

" O
If O
they O
ca O
n't O
move O

they O
are O
too O
weak O

then O
we O
will O
probably O
consider O
very O
seriously O

complex O

it O

CANBERRA I-LOC
1996-12-06 O

The O
Australian I-MISC
opposition O
on O
Friday O
demanded O
a O
high-powered O
investigation O

service O
after O
the O

court O

the O

the O

The O
court O
said O

Chris I-PER
